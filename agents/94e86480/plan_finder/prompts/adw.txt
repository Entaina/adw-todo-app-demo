## Plan Created Successfully ✅

**Plan Location:** `plans/dialogo-confirmacion-borrar-tarea.md`

### Summary
The plan covers the implementation of a confirmation dialog that will be displayed when a user attempts to delete a task. This prevents accidental deletions and provides a better user experience.

### Key Components
1. **ConfirmDialog Component** - A reusable modal component for confirmations
2. **State Management** - Track which task is pending deletion and dialog visibility
3. **User Flow** - Click delete → Show dialog → Confirm/Cancel → Execute/Abort deletion
4. **Comprehensive Testing** - Unit tests for the dialog component and integration tests for the full flow

### Implementation Phases
- **Phase 1:** Create the reusable ConfirmDialog component with tests
- **Phase 2:** Integrate the dialog into App.jsx with state management
- **Phase 3:** Update integration tests to verify the complete flow

### Features
- Modal backdrop to prevent background interactions
- Display task title in confirmation message
- Confirm (red/warning) and Cancel (neutral) buttons
- Reusable component for future confirmations
- Full test coverage
